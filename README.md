# crc-calculate
 Here, we will use Python 3 + Qt5 to code out the common CRC verification methods
 It includes the following items:
 
    "CRC_8" : "the poly is x^8 + x^5 + x^4 + 1",
    "CRC_16": "the poly is x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1",
    "CRC_24": "the poly is x^24 + x^23 + x^6 + x^5 + x + 1",
    "CRC_32": "the poly is x^32+ x^26 + x^23 + x^22 + x^16 + x^12 + x^11 + x^10 + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1",
